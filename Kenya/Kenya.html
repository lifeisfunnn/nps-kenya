    <h1>My Favorite National Parks in Kenya</h1>
   </heading> 
   <main>
    <p>Kenya is a country with very diverse landscapes, flora and fauna. There are many exciting things to do, from snorkelling in the Indian Ocean to climbing Mount Kenya (the second-highest mountain in Africa!). It is very difficult to choose, but these are my three favorite national parks in Kenya:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Aberdare National Park</strong></li>
        <p>You can do a great number of hikes with magical landscapes here. 'Dragon's Teeth' is an impressive formation of rocks that you can see in one day without going up too high in altitude.</p>

        <li><strong>Amboseli National Park</strong></li>
        <p>The park is a relatively popular destination for tourists, and understandably so. The savannah and its inhabitants are stunning. You can even see Kilimanjaro on a good day!</p>

        <li><strong>Meru National Park</strong></li>
        <p>Much less frequently visited by tourists, this is a great place to enjoy the scenery and see animals close up without anyone else around. The surrounding leave you feeling a great appreciation for nature.</p>

    <p>By the way, the <a href="https://www.kws.go.ke/" target="_blank">Kenya Wildlife Service</a> protects its national parks from poachers and illegal loggers.</p>
